        <p className="text-lg mt-2"> 👉 a versatile Fullstack Web Developer specializing in the MERN stack and Next.js. 
        I graduated from Bangladesh University of Professionals with a degree in Mass Communication and Journalism, 
        which means I know how to tell a story and create engaging user experiences—both in print and on the web! 📰➡️💻
        <br />
        <br />

After graduation, I dived into the world of web development through Programming Hero&apos;s rigorous bootcamps.
 In Level 1, I mastered JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, React Router DOM, and got a taste of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
 <br />
        <br />
Level 2 was where things got serious. I delved into TypeScript, Mongoose, advanced MongoDB, Express, Node, Redux, modular patterns, 
MVC architecture, and most important Next.js. I also explored a variety of design libraries like Ant Design, Material-UI, and ShadcnUI,NextUI,  and learned 
state management with Zustand. Plus, I can add some pizzazz to your projects with web animations! 😉

        <br />

In short, I&apos;m a one-stop shop for creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Whether you&apos;re 
looking for a seamless front-end experience or a robust back-end system, I&apos;ve got you covered. Let&apos;s build something 
amazing together! 💻🚀
